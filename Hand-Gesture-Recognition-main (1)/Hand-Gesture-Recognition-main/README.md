# Live Hand Gesture Recognition

    INTRODUCTION
***Background :-***

Communication is one of the major principles to deal with the surrounding environment. The
communication between people who are deaf or having an impaired hearing, with everyone
around is difficult. This is due to the lack of the common language between both parties.
Statistics and studies done by the World Health Organization showcases that 360 million
people around the world suffer from hearing loss. Hearing loss is one of the major public health
issues; that is considered to be the third most common physical condition after arthritis and
heart disease. Dumb people communicate with others using their body language merely;
especially their hand gestures. This communication mode is said to be complex, when dumb
uses their manual-visual language. Though these languages are used, however, they do not
have a typical origin and hence hard to interpret. Gesture recognition is the only way used to
interpret and understand sign language. Sign language is a unique type of communication
language which is essential for bridging the commuication gap between deaf and dumb people.
In each sign language, there are various signs with variations in palm size, shape and motion
and placement of hand which plays a major in each sign. A large number of applications have
been put forward by various researchers. In the past few years, in these applications many
remarkable changes have been made using deep learning concepts.

***Objective :-***

Our objective to create a hand gesture recognition system is to create a natural interaction
between human and computer where the recognized gestures can be used for controlling a
robot or conveying meaningful information. High priority for the system without making use
of any special hardware. All the computation should occur on a workstation or PC. Special
hardware would be used only to digitize the image (digital camera).

***Purpose :-***

Hand gestures are the natural way of interactions when one person is communicating with one
another and therefore hand movements can be treated as a non verbal form of communication.
The purpose of this hand gesture recognition project is understanding and classifying
meaningful movements by the human hands.

***Scope :-***

The scope of this project is to build a real time gesture classification system that can
automatically detect gestures in natural lighting condition. In order to accomplish this
objective, a real time gesture based system is developed to identify gestures.
This system will work as one of futuristic of Artificial Intelligence and computer vision with
user interface. It create method to recognize hand gesture based on different parameters.

***Applicability :-***

In today's modern age of technology, the Human-Computer Interaction is at its zenith of
innovation. However, there is lack of interfacing technologies to manipulate real-time
behaviour for operating various computer systems, software or devices. Even though to
overcome this problem there are several alternative solutions, like speech recognition system,
color marker based or glove based interfacing devices. But these devices are less portable have
complex structure and less accuracy. So to recover these disadvantages, we are introducing the
concept of hand gesture recognition system using only web camera of laptop. This will help to
use real time interfacing in digital world without any additional sensors or additional hardware.
Its simplicity improves efficiency and portability of system, making the project extensively
useful.
